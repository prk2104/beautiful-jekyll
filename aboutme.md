subtitle: Here are the examples of the work you asked for and a bit about my background
---

### my name is Peter Kay.   Here's a bit about me and what I do:

- I have been teaching math and statistics for 20 years and recently branched out to explore interests in data science.
- I learned Python and R and aspects of the data science pipeline; getting data, cleaning data, exploring and vizualizing data, modeling data, interpreting data and reporting data through a self-designed bootcamp using online resources.
- In addition to programming language capabilities, I have also completed projects in machine learning, image recognition, prediction, etc.  Some of that work is posted on the Github site.
- I came to New York City in 2018 to join the core of the data science world and interact with folks on the leading edge.
- I work with a small team of ML engineers on custom projects and also teach data analysis and statistics.
- I'm extremely loyal to my family.

### my history

I have degrees from Columbia University and M.I.T and have been fixing bicycles and cars and almost anything that is broken for most of my life.  I took those fix-it skills to the business world as an MBA type consultant and researcher early in my career.  I have a natural ability to get my hands dirty and new problems and collaborate on their solutions.  I look not only at data but at the problem that my client wants to solve and the environment in which they wish to solve it without getting lost in the technical details. 

### project interests
I am interested to work with small companies who have data that they want to capitalize on in whatever form and bring that data forward to gain new insight or discover patterns in it to help my clients become data-centric, function more effectively, and make predictions that reduce costs.
